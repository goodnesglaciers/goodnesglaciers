This is mainly a place where I store respositories of published work:
- Stevens et al. (2018): [Relationship between Greenland Ice Sheet surface speed and modeled effective pressure.](https://github.com/goodnesglaciers/nevis_regional)
- Stevens et al. (2021): [Helheim Glacier diurnal velocity fluctuations driven by surface melt forcing.](https://github.com/goodnesglaciers/helheim_diurnal_vels)
- Stevens et al. (2022): [Tidewater-glacier response to supraglacial lake drainage.](https://github.com/goodnesglaciers/nevis_helheim)
- Stevens et al. (2024): [Elastic stress coupling between supraglacial lakes.](https://github.com/goodnesglaciers/lake_strain)

Work in progress:
- Stevens et al. (202?): Ice-sheet hydro-fracture not advanced inland by low-elevation lake drainages. <br/> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;  With two Central West Greenland lake-drainage catalogues:
<br/> &emsp; &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;     - [Mechanistic Lake-Drainage Catalogue for 2022](https://github.com/goodnesglaciers/mechanistic_drainage_catalogue_2022)
